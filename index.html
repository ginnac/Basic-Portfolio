<p>Hi! My name is Ginna, I am a mother of a 2 year old. But I am more than that. I have studied arts and Graphic
Design in the Pontifical Catholic University of Peru, I studied there about 3 years and then moved in the United States 
of America. Since then I worked in the customer service field for more than 5 years, this experience has given me a lot of
interpersonal skills. Now I am eager to start a career in web development. 
</p>
<p>My passion for web development started when I realize how creative you can be when designing web pages and applications, 
eye catching and interactive web pages get most attention and so more visitors that will turn into customers. 
</p>
<p>Count with me to help you and your business to have the most eye catching and interactive web page and 
application that your customers will love.
